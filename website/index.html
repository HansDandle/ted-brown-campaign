                            <p>Democrats and Republicans — liberals and conservatives alike — have various plans to run your life. They believe "there ought to be a law." Libertarians believe "there ought to be a choice." Leave people alone and they will grow and prosper.</p>

                            <p>Government officials pass law after law, tax after tax, and regulation after regulation. Politicians and bureaucrats want power over our lives. They don't care whether their plans work or not — as long as they have "good intentions." There are too many laws. I am not running for U.S. Senator to be a "lawmaker." I am running to repeal as many laws as I can.</p>

                            <p>There are basic laws that we all know to follow. Crimes such as murder, rape, robbery and fraud should be illegal. But there are actually thousands of pages of laws, which turn non-violent personal behavior into crimes, or which create countless bureaucratic administrative offenses. It's been said that Americans commit three felonies a day without even knowing it. There are 137,000 armed federal agents from 83 different agencies who are prepared to enforce all of these laws and regulations. Here in Texas, there are over 78,000 licensed "peace officers" working for over 2,700 police agencies.</p>

                            <p>The other candidates for U.S. Senator in all other parties want to run your life; they want more and bigger government. I am the candidate who wants less.</p>

                            <h4>What Libertarians Have Accomplished:</h4>
                            
                                <li><strong>No Libertarian has ever raised anyone's taxes</strong> — In fact, in 1982, Libertarian legislators in Alaska succeeded in repealing the state income tax.</li>
                                <li><strong>Pioneered privatization</strong> — Libertarians coined the term "privatization," meaning government services can be more efficiently provided by free market competition.</li>
                                <li><strong>Opposed the War on Drugs for over 50 years</strong> — Libertarians have fought this failed policy since the very beginning.</li>
                                <li><strong>Advocated for marriage equality</strong> — Libertarians spoke up for gay and lesbian Americans' right to marry in the 1970s, decades before Democrats did.</li>
                                <li><strong>Fought for privacy and liberty</strong> — Libertarians have challenged laws that violate personal privacy and liberty at the federal, state, and local levels.</li>
                                <li><strong>Opposed unnecessary wars</strong> — Libertarians are consistently anti-war and against foreign intervention, unlike the warmongers of the other parties.</li>
                            </ul>
<br>
                            <p>When you vote, remember that voting for the lesser of two evils still means voting for evil.</p>

                            <p>You don't have to vote for a Democrat or a Republican. You can see what those establishment parties have done to our nation. Instead, vote for a candidate who will not buckle under special interests and partisan pressures.</p>

                            <p><strong>Vote for Libertarian Ted Brown to send a message that you want a big change in the way they do business at the U.S. Capitol.</strong></p>

                            <p>The U.S. once had the finest health care system in the world. The standard of care was growing by leaps and bounds. Health care was reasonably priced, so that most people didn't even feel the need to buy health insurance except for catastrophic illnesses. Doctors and hospitals voluntarily provided free health care to the poor.</p>

                            <blockquote>"Liberty for each, for all, and forever!"<br><cite>- William Lloyd Garrison</cite></blockquote>
                            <blockquote>Let me be a free man – free to travel, free to stop, free to work, free to trade where I choose, free to choose my own teachers, free to follow the religion of my fathers, free to think and talk and act for myself.<br><cite>- Chief Joseph, Nez Perce tribe, 1877</cite></blockquote>
                            <blockquote>"The welfare of the people in particular has always been the alibi of tyrants, and it provides the further advantage of giving the servants of tyranny a good conscience."<br><cite>- Albert Camus (1913-1960)</cite></blockquote>
                            <blockquote>"Necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom. It is the argument of tyrants; it is the creed of slaves."<br><cite>- William Pitt (1759-1806)</cite></blockquote>
                            <blockquote>"The further a society drifts from truth, the more it will hate those who speak it."<br><cite>- George Orwell (1903-1950)</cite></blockquote>
                            <blockquote>"Politics is the art of looking for trouble, finding it whether it exists or not, diagnosing it incorrectly, and applying the wrong remedy."<br><cite>- Ernest Benn (1875-1954)</cite></blockquote>
                            <blockquote>"If you want government to intervene domestically, you're a liberal. If you want government to intervene overseas, you're a conservative. If you want government to intervene everywhere, you're a moderate. If you don't want government to intervene anywhere, you're an extremist."<br><cite>- Joseph Sobran (1946-2010)</cite></blockquote>
                            <blockquote>"(Government in America) has taken on a vast mass of new duties and responsibilities; it has spread out its powers until they penetrate to every act of the citizen, however secret; it has begun to throw around its operations the high dignity and impeccability of religion; its agents become a separate and superior caste, with authority to bind and loose, and their thumbs in every pot. But it still remains, as it was in the beginning, the common enemy of all well-disposed, industrious and decent men."<br><cite>- H. L. Mencken (1880-1956)</cite></blockquote>
                            <blockquote>"Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered. Yet we have this consolation with us: the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly. It would be strange indeed if so celebrated an article as freedom should not be highly rated."<br><cite>- Thomas Paine (1737-1809)</cite></blockquote>
