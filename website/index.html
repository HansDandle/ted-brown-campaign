                    <p>Ted Brown was born in 1960 in Steubenville, Ohio, of German, Greek, and Jewish ancestry. Both of his grandfathers immigrated to the U.S. Ted graduated from UCLA in 1984, earning a B.A. in political science with a concentration in Constitutional Law.</p>
                    
                    <p>Until his recent retirement, Ted worked in the insurance industry as a self-employed independent insurance adjuster, specializing in auto, property, and general liability claims.</p>
                    
                    <p>Ted and his wife Laura have been married since 1984. They lived in Southern California for many years before moving to Austin, where they live in the Wells Branch neighborhood. Laura taught at Austin Community College before her retirement. They have one adult daughter named Katie, who is a fundraiser for a major university hospital.</p>
                    
                    <p>Ted joined the Libertarian Party in 1979 and has been active his entire adult life. He served as Chairman of the Libertarian Party of California and as a member of the Libertarian National Committee. He is currently Vice Chair of the Libertarian Party of Travis County, Candidate Coordinator for the Libertarian Party of Texas, and a member of the Texas State Libertarian Executive Committee (SLEC).</p>

                            <p>The U.S. once had the finest health care system in the world. The standard of care was growing by leaps and bounds. Health care was reasonably priced, so that most people didn't even feel the need to buy health insurance except for catastrophic illnesses. Doctors and hospitals voluntarily provided free health care to the poor.</p>
